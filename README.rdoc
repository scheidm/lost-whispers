===Work in Progress

Lost Whispers will be a light-weight RoR Wiki based around the idea that each
user may have different levels of information on a given topic. The idea is that
it would be used to share sensitive information or private messages amongst a
small community, be that a small business, a family household, or even a simple
role-playing group. 

At the moment we've got a data structure without proper implementation. Come
check back later for more!
